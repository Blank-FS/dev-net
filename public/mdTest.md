# DevNet

## Description

The projects are intended to be at any level with difficulty and commitment levels specified in each of the projects so everyone can work on projects regardless of their progress in their career. Peeople can form communities/clubs with each other as a way to bond and network to build lasting connections and friendships.

## Sections

There is currently three sections to this application - Home, Discover, and Profile.

- The Profile section is designated to modify one's personal information like a brief self intro and tech stack, and see one's stats like # of connections, followers, and what projects they are in, etc.
- The Discover section is a place for users to find interesting projects they want to contribute to. There will be a help request board for projects who are seeking assistance with each project having a list of attributes they are looking for in a contributor. User can filter request board based on tech stack, difficult level, and commitment level, etc. Besides the help request board, a feed section is planned that will feature trending posts and posts by followed projects/developers for users to interact with.
- The Home section will be the main social place for a user. The project section has all the projects the user is in and offers and work space for them to collaborate with other contributors. The club section has all the clubs the user is in to chat with other people based on the club's purpose/topic. The DM section is for direct messaging between the user and their connections.
